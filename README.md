## üìù Project Summary

This project is a hands-on simulation of a corporate IT Help Desk environment built using Jira Service Management. The goal was to gain practical experience in modern IT Service Management (ITSM) by managing the complete lifecycle of common support tickets.

This project demonstrates the ability to effectively use an enterprise-grade ticketing system to track, prioritize, and resolve user-submitted issues, a core requirement for any IT support role. It showcases skills in ticket documentation, workflow management, and building a user-facing knowledge base.

* **Troubleshooting & Documentation:** Documented all troubleshooting steps, user communications, and resolutions within each ticket's activity log.
* **Workflow Management:** Worked with different ticket types (Service Request, Incident) and their corresponding workflows and statuses.
* **Knowledge Base Creation:** Authored and published a knowledge base article to enable user self-service and deflect future tickets.
* **Customer Service:** Practiced writing clear and professional communications to end-users within the ticketing system.

## üìñ Step-by-Step Project Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for replicating this project, with screenshots included at each key stage.

### Phase 0: Setting Up the Service Desk

1.  **Sign Up for Jira:** Go to the [Jira Service Management Free Plan](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management/free) and sign up for an account.
2.  **Create a Site:** Follow the prompts to create a unique site URL (e.g., `yourname-helpdesk.atlassian.net`).
3.  **Create a Project:** When prompted, select the **"IT Service Management"** template and name your project (e.g., `Corporate IT Help Desk`). The result is a customer-facing portal where users can submit requests.

### Phase 1: Simulating Help Desk Tickets

For each scenario, first act as the **user** and raise a request through the customer portal. Then, act as the **agent** to process and resolve the ticket in the Jira queues.

1.  **Ticket 1: The Password Reset**
    * **User Action:** From the portal, raise a "Help with my account" request for "John Smith" who is locked out of his laptop.
    * **Agent Action:** Open the ticket. Add an internal note: `Verified user's identity via phone.` Add a public comment: `Hi John, I have sent a password reset link to your recovery email.` Change the status to **Resolved**.
